(** Extract performance metrics from a log file and calculate average execution times.

  This function reads a log file line by line, parses each line as a JSON log entry,
  and extracts performance metrics identified by the "is_perf_metric" metadata field.
  For each performance metric entry, it extracts the "elapsed" time and "label" fields.

  @param log_file Path to the log file to process
  @return A deferred list of tuples containing (operation_label, average_time_in_ms)

  The function performs the following steps:
  1. Reads all lines from the specified log file
  2. Filters and parses lines containing performance metrics
  3. Groups metrics by operation label
  4. Calculates the average execution time for each operation

  @raises Failure if a log line cannot be parsed as valid JSON
  @raises exn if required metadata fields ("elapsed" or "label") are missing *)
