O(1) Labs is aiming to develop the first cryptocurrency protocol that can deliver on the promise of supporting real-world applications and widespread use. Our team is based in San Francisco, and we are funded by top investors (including Polychain, Metastable, Max Levchin, and Naval Ravikant).

We're bringing Coda Protocol to market, a cryptocurrency that compresses the blockchain from hundreds of gigabytes down to the size of a few tweets. It can scale to thousands of transactions per second and millions of users while remaining decentralized enough for cellphones to be fully verifying nodes. We're seeking a product manager who can navigate the complex and interdisciplinary tradeoffs that come with deploying a new economic system.

Product managers will:

* Lead the conceptual development of new initiatives and projects
* Help build a store of value accessible to hundreds of millions of users, particularly focused on those in developing countries
* Strategize key decision affecting the Coda platform, and lead the development of key early applications aimed at a wide audience
* Develop the strategic roadmap for core products, including a wallet application with social features and a developer-focused payment API, and collaborate with engineers to realize the vision

This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems that span cryptography, engineering, product design, economics, and sociology. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.

Ideal candidates will be interested in any of:

* Design
* Growth strategies
* Data analysis
* Market structure
* Mechanism design
* Cryptocurrency

If you'd be interested in talking further, please get in touch by sending an email with your resume and the subject "Product Manager applicant" to [jobs@o1labs.org](mailto:jobs@o1labs.org?subject="Product Manager applicant").

We are committed to building a diverse, inclusive company. People of color, LGBTQ individuals, women, and people with disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply.
