O(1) Labs is aiming to develop the first cryptocurrency protocol that can deliver on the promise of supporting real-world applications and widespread use. Our team is based in San Francisco, and we are funded by top investors (including Polychain, Metastable, Max Levchin, and Naval Ravikant).

We're bringing Coda Protocol to market, a cryptocurrency that compresses the blockchain from hundreds of gigabytes down to the size of a few tweets. It can scale to thousands of transactions per second and millions of users while remaining decentralized enough for cellphones to be fully verifying nodes.

We’re working on technologies with the potential to reimagine social structures. We believe it’s important to incorporate diverse perspectives from conception through realization.

This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems that span cryptography, engineering, product design, economics, and sociology. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.

We're seeking someone can be an empathetic and caring mentor to engineers with diverse perspectives, a great communicator, and who can prioritize and collaborate across engineering disciplines.

Engineering managers will:

* Help decide who works on what and when, minimizing unnecessary process and developing nurturing environments where engineers feel empowered to contribute their best work
* Collaborate broadly to design well-informed engineering roadmaps
* Contribute to the project technically (as an estimated percent of time, perhaps 30% engineering and 70% management)
* Provide empathetic leadership and impactful mentoring   

Ideal candidates will be interested in:

* Technical leadership
* Mentorship
* Functional programming

There are no hard requirements and we're more interested in learning about your individual background.

If you'd be interested in talking further, please get in touch by sending an email with your resume and the subject "Engineering Manager Applicant" to [jobs@o1labs.org](mailto:jobs@o1labs.org?subject="Engineering Manager Applicant").

We are committed to building a diverse, inclusive company. People of color, LGBTQ individuals, women, and people with disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply.
