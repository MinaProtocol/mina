     There are 3 cases of bootstrap that we need to test:

     1: short bootstrap-- bootstrap where node has been down for less than 2k+1 blocks
     2: medium bootstrap-- bootstrap where node has been down for more than 2k+1 blocks, OR equivalently when the blockchain is longer than 2k+1 blocks and a node goes down and resets to a fresh state, thereby resetting at the genesis block, before reconnecting to the network
     3: long bootstrap-- bootstrap where node has been down for more than 42k slots (2 epochs) where each epoch emitted at least 1 parallel scan state proof

  (* this test is the medium bootstrap test *)
