(** limits on Zkapp_command.t size
    10.26*np + 10.08*n2 + 9.14*n1 < 69.45
    where np: number of single proof updates
    n2: number of pairs of signed/no-auth update
    n1: number of single signed/no-auth update
    and their coefficients representing the cost
  The formula was generated based on benchmarking data conducted on bare
  metal i9 processor with room to include lower spec.
  69.45 was the total time for a combination of updates that was considered
  acceptable.
  The method used to estimate the cost was linear least squares.
