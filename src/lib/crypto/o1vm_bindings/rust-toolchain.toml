#
# To update the version of Rust used in Mina (to pass CI),
# you will have to follow these steps:
#
# 1. grep for the current version of Rust in the codebase (e.g. "1.58.1") and update all instances
# 2. get CI to build your PR
# 3. check the "docker" rules in CI to see what the hashes of the (newly) built docker files are
# 4. figure out the hashes of the (now obsolete) docker images used in CI rules that are failing, grep for these hashes and replace them with the new hashes
