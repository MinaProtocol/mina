//! # Binary Canonical Serialization (BCS)
//!
//! BCS (formerly "Libra Canonical Serialization" or LCS) is a serialization format developed
//! in the context of the [Diem](https://diem.com) blockchain.
//!
//! BCS was designed with the following main goals in mind:
//! * provide good performance and concise (binary) representations;
//! * support a rich set of data types commonly used in Rust;
//! * enforce canonical serialization, meaning that every value of a given type should have
//! a single valid representation.
//!
//! BCS also aims to mitigate the consequence of malicious inputs by enforcing well-defined limits
//! on large or nested containers during (de)serialization.
//!
//! ## Rust Implementation
//!
//! This crate provides a Rust implementation of BCS as an encoding format for the [Serde library](https://serde.rs).
//! As such, this implementation covers most data types supported by Serde -- including user-defined structs,
//! tagged variants (Rust enums), tuples, and maps -- excluding floats, single unicode characters (char), and sets.
//!
//! BCS is also available in other programming languages, thanks to the separate project [serde-reflection](https://github.com/novifinancial/serde-reflection).
//!
//! ## Application to Cryptography
//!
//! The BCS format guarantees canonical serialization, meaning that for any given data type, there
//! is a one-to-one correspondance between in-memory values and valid byte representations.
//!
//! In the context of a cryptographic application, canonical serialization has several benefits:
//! * It provides a natural and reliable way to associate in-memory values to cryptographic hashes.
//! * It allows the signature of a message to be defined equivalently as the signature of the serialized bytes or as the signature of the in-memory value.
//!
//! Note that BCS ensures canonical serialization for each data type separately. The data type of a serialized value
//! must be enforced by the application itself. This requirement is typically fulfilled
//! using unique hash seeds for each data type. (See [Diem's cryptographic library](https://github.com/diem/diem/blob/master/crypto/crypto/src/hash.rs) for an example.)
//!
//! ## Backwards Compatibility
//!
//! By design, BCS does not provide implicit versioning or backwards/forwards compatibility, therefore
//! applications must carefully plan in advance for adhoc extension points:
//! * Enums may be used for explicit versioning and backward compatibility (e.g. extensible query interfaces).
//! * In some cases, data fields of type `Vec<u8>` may also be added to allow (future) unknown payloads
//! in serialized form.
//!
//! ## Detailed Specifications
//!
//! BCS supports the following data types:
//!
//! * Booleans
//! * Signed 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit integers
//! * Unsigned 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit, and 128-bit integers
//! * Option
//! * Unit (an empty value)
//! * Fixed and variable length sequences
//! * UTF-8 Encoded Strings
//! * Tuples
//! * Structures (aka "structs")
//! * Externally tagged enumerations (aka "enums")
//! * Maps
//!
//! BCS is not a self-describing format. As such, in order to deserialize a message, one must
//! know the message type and layout ahead of time.
//!
//! Unless specified, all numbers are stored in little endian, two's complement format.
//!
//! ### Recursion and Depth of BCS Data
//!
//! Recursive data-structures (e.g. trees) are allowed. However, because of the possibility of stack
//! overflow during (de)serialization, the *container depth* of any valid BCS data cannot exceed the constant
//! `MAX_CONTAINER_DEPTH`. Formally, we define *container depth* as the number of structs and enums traversed
//! during (de)serialization.
//!
//! This definition aims to minimize the number of operations while ensuring that
//! (de)serialization of a known BCS format cannot cause arbitrarily large stack allocations.
//!
//! As an example, if `v1` and `v2` are values of depth `n1` and `n2`,
//! * a struct value `Foo { v1, v2 }` has depth `1 + max(n1, n2)`;
//! * an enum value `E::Foo { v1, v2 }` has depth `1 + max(n1, n2)`;
//! * a pair `(v1, v2)` has depth `max(n1, n2)`;
//! * the value `Some(v1)` has depth `n1`.
//!
//! All string and integer values have depths `0`.
//!
//! ### Booleans and Integers
//!

//!
//! ### ULEB128-Encoded Integers
//!
//! The BCS format also uses the [ULEB128 encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128) internally
//! to represent unsigned 32-bit integers in two cases where small values are usually expected:
//! (1) lengths of variable-length sequences and (2) tags of enum values (see the corresponding
//! sections below).
//!
//! |Type                       |Original data          |Hex representation |Serialized bytes   |
//! |---                        |---                    |---                |---                |
//! |ULEB128-encoded u32-integer|2^0 = 1                |0x00000001         |01                 |
//! |                           |2^7 = 128              |0x00000080         |80 01              |
//! |                           |2^14 = 16384           |0x00004000         |80 80 01           |
//! |                           |2^21 = 2097152         |0x00200000         |80 80 80 01        |
//! |                           |2^28 = 268435456       |0x10000000         |80 80 80 80 01     |
//! |                           |9487                   |0x0000250f         |8f 4a              |
//!
//! In general, a ULEB128 encoding consists of a little-endian sequence of base-128 (7-bit)
//! digits. Each digit is completed into a byte by setting the highest bit to 1, except for the
//! last (highest-significance) digit whose highest bit is set to 0.
//!
//! In BCS, the result of decoding ULEB128 bytes is required to fit into a 32-bit unsigned
//! integer and be in canonical form. For instance, the following values are rejected:
//! * 80 80 80 80 80 01 (2^36) is too large.
//! * 80 80 80 80 10 (2^33) is too large.
//! * 80 00 is not a minimal encoding of 0.
//!
//! ### Optional Data
//!
//! Optional or nullable data either exists in its full representation or does not. BCS represents
//! this as a single byte representing the presence `0x01` or absence `0x00` of data. If the data
//! is present then the serialized form of that data follows. For example:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use bcs::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! let some_data: Option<u8> = Some(8);
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&some_data)?, vec![1, 8]);
//!
//! let no_data: Option<u8> = None;
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&no_data)?, vec![0]);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Fixed and Variable Length Sequences
//!
//! Sequences can be made of up of any BCS supported types (even complex structures) but all
//! elements in the sequence must be of the same type. If the length of a sequence is fixed and
//! well known then BCS represents this as just the concatenation of the serialized form of each
//! individual element in the sequence. If the length of the sequence can be variable, then the
//! serialized sequence is length prefixed with a ULEB128-encoded unsigned integer indicating
//! the number of elements in the sequence. All variable length sequences must be
//! `MAX_SEQUENCE_LENGTH` elements long or less.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use bcs::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! let fixed: [u16; 3] = [1, 2, 3];
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&fixed)?, vec![1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0]);
//!
//! let variable: Vec<u16> = vec![1, 2];
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&variable)?, vec![2, 1, 0, 2, 0]);
//!
//! let large_variable_length: Vec<()> = vec![(); 9_487];
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&large_variable_length)?, vec![0x8f, 0x4a]);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Strings
//!
//! Only valid UTF-8 Strings are supported. BCS serializes such strings as a variable length byte
//! sequence, i.e. length prefixed with a ULEB128-encoded unsigned integer followed by the byte
//! representation of the string.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use bcs::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! // Note that this string has 10 characters but has a byte length of 24
//! let utf8_str = "çå∞≠¢õß∂ƒ∫";
//! let expecting = vec![
//!     24, 0xc3, 0xa7, 0xc3, 0xa5, 0xe2, 0x88, 0x9e, 0xe2, 0x89, 0xa0, 0xc2,
//!     0xa2, 0xc3, 0xb5, 0xc3, 0x9f, 0xe2, 0x88, 0x82, 0xc6, 0x92, 0xe2, 0x88, 0xab,
//! ];
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&utf8_str)?, expecting);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Tuples
//!
//! Tuples are typed composition of objects: `(Type0, Type1)`
//!
//! Tuples are considered a fixed length sequence where each element in the sequence can be a
//! different type supported by BCS. Each element of a tuple is serialized in the order it is
//! defined within the tuple, i.e. [tuple.0, tuple.2].
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use bcs::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! let tuple = (-1i8, "diem");
//! let expecting = vec![0xFF, 4, b'd', b'i', b'e', b'm'];
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&tuple)?, expecting);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//!
//! ### Structures
//!
//! Structures are fixed length sequences consisting of fields with potentially different types.
//! Each field within a struct is serialized in the order specified by the canonical structure
//! definition. Structs can exist within other structs and as such, BCS recurses into each struct
//! and serializes them in order. There are no labels in the serialized format, the struct ordering
//! defines the organization within the serialization stream.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use bcs::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # use serde::Serialize;
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! #[derive(Serialize)]
//! struct MyStruct {
//!     boolean: bool,
//!     bytes: Vec<u8>,
//!     label: String,
//! }
//!
//! #[derive(Serialize)]
//! struct Wrapper {
//!     inner: MyStruct,
//!     name: String,
//! }
//!
//! let s = MyStruct {
//!     boolean: true,
//!     bytes: vec![0xC0, 0xDE],
//!     label: "a".to_owned(),
//! };
//! let s_bytes = to_bytes(&s)?;
//! let mut expecting = vec![1, 2, 0xC0, 0xDE, 1, b'a'];
//! assert_eq!(s_bytes, expecting);
//!
//! let w = Wrapper {
//!     inner: s,
//!     name: "b".to_owned(),
//! };
//! let w_bytes = to_bytes(&w)?;
//! assert!(w_bytes.starts_with(&s_bytes));
//!
//! expecting.append(&mut vec![1, b'b']);
//! assert_eq!(w_bytes, expecting);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//! ### Externally Tagged Enumerations
//!
//! An enumeration is typically represented as a type that can take one of potentially many
//! different variants. In BCS, each variant is mapped to a variant index, a ULEB128-encoded 32-bit unsigned
//! integer, followed by serialized data if the type has an associated value. An
//! associated type can be any BCS supported type. The variant index is determined based on the
//! ordering of the variants in the canonical enum definition, where the first variant has an index
//! of `0`, the second an index of `1`, etc.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use bcs::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # use serde::Serialize;
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! #[derive(Serialize)]
//! enum E {
//!     Variant0(u16),
//!     Variant1(u8),
//!     Variant2(String),
//! }
//!
//! let v0 = E::Variant0(8000);
//! let v1 = E::Variant1(255);
//! let v2 = E::Variant2("e".to_owned());
//!
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&v0)?, vec![0, 0x40, 0x1F]);
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&v1)?, vec![1, 0xFF]);
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&v2)?, vec![2, 1, b'e']);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
//!
//! If you need to serialize a C-style enum, you should use a primitive integer type.
//!
//! ### Maps (Key / Value Stores)
//!
//! Maps are represented as a variable-length, sorted sequence of (Key, Value) tuples. Keys must be
//! unique and the tuples sorted by increasing lexicographical order on the BCS bytes of each key.
//! The representation is otherwise similar to that of a variable-length sequence. In particular,
//! it is preceded by the number of tuples, encoded in ULEB128.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use bcs::{Result, to_bytes};
//! # use std::collections::HashMap;
//! # fn main() -> Result<()> {
//! let mut map = HashMap::new();
//! map.insert(b'e', b'f');
//! map.insert(b'a', b'b');
//! map.insert(b'c', b'd');
//!
//! let expecting = vec![(b'a', b'b'), (b'c', b'd'), (b'e', b'f')];
//!
//! assert_eq!(to_bytes(&map)?, to_bytes(&expecting)?);
//! # Ok(())}
//! ```
