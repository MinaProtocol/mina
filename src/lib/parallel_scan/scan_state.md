# Scan State Refactoring

Parallel scan state is a data structure implemented to efficiently fold over infinite stream of data, periodically returning results of the operation associated with it. It is currently used to keep track of transactions for which snarks (ledger proofs) are to be generated . Read [this](https://codaprotocol.com/blog/scanning_for_scans.html) to learn more.
The parallel scan state is a forest of full-binary trees with leaves (or called `Base` nodes) instantiated with values of type `Transaction_with_witness.t` and intermediate nodes (or called `Merge` nodes) instantiated with values of type `Ledger_proof_with_sok_message.t` in the module `Transaction_snark_scan_state`. Each node is a job that is to becompleted by a snark worker.

Everytime a transition (block) is applied, the transactions in it are transformed to new base jobs and added to the scan state. A transition also includes completed works that correspond to a sequence of jobs that already exist in the scan state. These, when added to scan state, create new merge jobs except when it is for the root node in which case the proof is simply returned as the result.

The following constants dictate the structure and behaviour of the scan state.

1. *Transaction_capacity_log_2*: $2^{transaction\_capacity\_log\_2}$ is the maximum number of transactions (or base jobs) that can be added per block and the maximum number of proofs that is to be done is $2^{transaction\_capacity\_log\_2 + 1} - 1$. Prorated work for a transaction is two proofs except for transaction that occupies the last slot which is just one proof.

2. *Work_delay*: Every block adds new jobs on to the scan state; some base jobs and others merge jobs. Since generating snarks take time, all the work that was added in the current block may not be completed by the time next block is generated. Therefore, we add *work_delay* extra trees to accumulate enough work over *work_delay* blocks. This ensures the amount of work that is required to be completed are created in blocks before the last *work_delay* blocks which would give enough time for the snarks to be generated.

Given these two constants, the parallel scan state is a forest of at most $(transaction\_capacity\_log\_2 + 1) * (work\_delay + 1) + 1$ trees with each tree having exactly $2^{transaction\_capacity\_log\_2}$ leaves.

The following snapshots of the scan state after each block with $transaction\_capacity\_log\_2=2$ and $work\_delay=1$ will help visualizing how this would work. Having a *work_delay* of 1 ensures the jobs that needs to be done are from blocks before the last block.

Note: M*i* for merge nodes and B*i* for base nodes where *i* is the block in which the work was added.

Block 9: Three transactions (B9's); complete three proofs (M6's) for the slots to be occupied in the currently unfilled tree. Four proofs were added in the previous block and therefore only three more needs to be done (maximum work given the constants is 7). For the thrid transaction which goes in a new tree, complete the next two proofs (B7's). The M6 proof from the last tree is returned as the ledger proof.

        _     _             _     _
    B10  B11  B11  B11    _  _  _  _

 The number work that needs to be done is predetermined and depends on the number of slots occupied and which slot is occupied. The last slot of a tree requires only 1 proof to be done. This is because the total work that needs to be done is $2^{transaction\_capacity\_log\_2 - 1}$. The amount of work is always fixed based on the position of the slots being filled.
 Having this constraint ensures:

1. Multiple proofs are not emitted per update

2. The merge node that is to be updated after adding proofs corresponding to its children is always empty. This allows us keep the number of trees to a minimum of $work\_delay+2$.

For a given throughput, the latency (number of blocks before a new ledger proof is emitted) in the proposed implementation is better (at least twice as much) because it emits a ledger proof for every $2^{transaction\_capacity\_log\_2}$ transactions. In steady state (when all slots are filled and all the required proofs are done), a ledger proof would be emitted every block.

## Types

```ocaml

type 'd base =
    | Empty
    | Full of ('d * sequence_number)

type 'a merge =
    | Empty
    | Part of 'a
    | Full of ('a * 'a * sequence_number)


type ('a, 'd) tree = Base of 'd | Merge of 'a * ('a * 'a, 'd * 'd) tree
(*This structure works well because we always complete all the nodes on a specific level before proceeding to the next level and therefore O(log n) access for updating any number of nodes *)

type ('a, 'd) t =
    {trees: ('a merge, 'd base) tree list
    ; acc: int * ('a * 'd list) option
    (* last emitted proof and the corresponding transactions*)
    ; curr_job_seq_no: int
    (* Sequence number for the jobs added every block*)
    ; max_base_jobs: int

    ; delay: int }
