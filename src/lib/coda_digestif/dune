(* This disgusting hack of a file recursively invokes dune to build
config.mlh, so we can read it to figure out if we should depend on digestif.c
or digestif.ocaml. We only depend on digestif.c when fake_hash is set. This
means `make web` will be entirely broken, but we shouldn't need it in those
contexts anyway.

If https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/1776 were implemented, we would
not need this.

We break the recursion with an environment variable. Otherwise we'd be
infinitely invoking dune, and you'd run out of memory, file descriptors,
or process table entries.
