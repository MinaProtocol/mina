(** A node can be represented in two different formats.
 *  A full node representation is a breadcrumb, which
 *  contains both an external transition and a computed
 *  staged ledger (masked off of the node parent's
 *  staged ledger). A lite node representation is merely
 *  the external transition itself. The staged ledger
 *  can be recomputed if needed, though not cheaply.
 *  The purpose of the separation of these two formats
 *  is required due to the fact that a breadcrumb cannot
 *  be serialized with bin_io. Only the external transition
 *  can be serialized and persisted to disk. This node
 *  representation type is used to parameterize the diff
 *  type over which representation is being used so that
 *  the diff format can be shared between both the in memory
 *  transition frontier and the persistent transition frontier.

(** A transition frontier diff represents a single item
 *  of mutation that can be or has been performed on
 *  a transition frontier. Each diff is associated with
 *  a type parameter that represents a "diff mutant".
 *  A "diff mutant" is any information related to the
 *  correct application of a diff which is not encapsulated
 *  directly within the itself. This is used for computing
 *  the transition frontier incremental hash. For example,
 *  if some diff adds some new information, the diff itself
 *  would contain the information it's adding, but if the
 *  act of adding that information correctly to the transition
 *  frontier depends on some other state at the time the
 *  diff is applied, that state should be represented in mutant
 *  parameter for that diff.

   *  a node merely depends on its parent being in the
   *  transition frontier already. If the parent wasn't
   *  already in the transition frontier, attempting to
   *  process this diff would generate an error instead. *)
  | Root_transitioned : 'repr Root_transition.t -> ('repr, State_hash.t) t
      (** A diff representing that the transition frontier root
   *  has been moved forward. The diff contains the state hash
   *  of the new root, as well as state hashes of all nodes that
   *  were garbage collected by this root change. Garbage is
   *  topologically sorted from oldest to youngest. The old root
   *  should not be included in the garbage since it is implicitly
   *  removed. The mutant for this diff is the state hash of the
   *  old root. This ensures that all transition frontiers agreed
   *  on the old roots value at the time of processing this diff.

  | Best_tip_changed : State_hash.t -> (_, State_hash.t) t
