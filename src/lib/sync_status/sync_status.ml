(** Sync_status represent states interacting with peers in the coda protocol.
    When the protocol is starting, the node should be in the CONNECT state
    trying to connect to a peer. Once it connects to a peer, the node should be
    in the LISTENING state waiting for peers to send a message to them. When
    the node receives a constant flow of messages, its state should be SYNCED.
    However, when the node is bootstrapping, its state is BOOTSTRAPPING. If it
    hasn’t received messages for some time
    (Coda_compile_config.inactivity_secs), then it is OFFLINE. *)
