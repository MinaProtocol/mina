       particular set of arguments. Unfortunately, unit tests use the inline
       test binary -- which doesn't support these arguments -- and so we're not
       able to use these [Rpc_parallel] calls. Here we detect this and call out
       to the dummy verifier instead.
       The implementation of dummy is equivalent to the one with
       [proof_level <> Full], so this should make no difference. Inline tests
       shouldn't be run with [proof_level = Full].
