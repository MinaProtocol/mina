(* Let F, K be the two fields (either (Fp, Fq) or (Fq, Fp)).
   Each proof over F has an accumulator state which contains
   - a set of IPA challenges c_0, ..., c_{k-1}, which can be interpreted as F elements.
   - a polynomial commitment challenge_polynomial_commitment, which has coordinates in K.

   This part of the accumulator state is finalized by checking that challenge_polynomial_commitment
   is a commitment to the polynomial

   f_c := prod_{i = 0}^{k-1} (1 + c_i x^{2^{k-1 - i}})

   When incrementally-verifying such a proof in a K-circuit (since we need K-arithmetic to perform
   the group operations on the F-polynomial-commitments that constitute the proof),
   instead of checking this, we get an evaluation E_c at a random point zeta and check
   that challenge_polynomial_commitment opens to E_c at zeta. Then we will need to check that
   E_c = f_c(zeta) = prod_{i = 0}^{k-1} (1 + c_i zeta^{2^{k-1 - i}}).

   However, because we are then in a K-circuit, we cannot actually compute f_c(zeta), which requires
   F-arithmetic.

   Therefore, after incrementally verifying the F-proof, the challenges (c_0, ..., c_{k-1}) which are
   part of the accumulator of the F-proof we just incrementally verified, must remain part of
   the accumulator of the K-proof, along with E_c (or at least some kind of commitment to it, which is
   what we actually do).

   Then, when we incrementally verify that K-proof in an F-circuit, we will check that E_c was
   computed correctly using c_0, ..., c_{k-1} and they along with E_c can be discarded.

   So, to summarize, the accumulator state for each proof P (corresponding to an F-circuit)
   contains
   - a set of IPA challenges (thought of as K-elements) for every proof that it incrementally verified inside its circuit
   - a challenge_polynomial_commitment (coordinates in F) for every proof that it incrementally verified inside its circuit
   - a challenge_polynomial_commitment (coordinates in K) corresponding to P's own inner-product argument
   - a set of IPA challenges (thought of as F-elements) corresponding to P's own inner-product argument

(** Represents a proof (along with its accumulation state) which wraps a

    To have some notation, the proof S itself comes from a circuit that verified
    up to 'max_proofs_verified many wrap proofs W_0, ..., W_max_proofs_verified.
