  (* Compute deferred values - in the Pickles recursive proof system, deferred values
     are values from 2 proofs earlier in the recursion hierarchy.  Every recursion
     goes through a two-phase process of step and wrap, like so

       step <- wrap <- step <- ... <- wrap <- step,
          `<-----------'
             deferred

     where there may be multiple children at each level (but let's ignore that!).
     Deferred values are values (part of the public input) that must be passed between
     the two phases in order to be verified correctly-- it works like this.

       - The wrap proof is passed the deferred values for its step proof as part of its public input.
       - The wrap proof starts verifying the step proof.  As part of this verification it must
         perform all of the group element checks (since it's over the Vesta base field); however,
         at this stage it just assumes that the deferred values of its public input are correct
         (i.e. it defers checking them).
       - The next step proof verifies the wrap proof with a similar process, but using the other
         curve (e.g. Pallas).  There are two important things to note:
           - Since it is using the other curve, it can compute the commitments to the public inputs
             of the previous wrap circuit that were passed into it.  In other words, the next step
             proof receives data from the previous wrap proof about the previous step proof.  Yeah,
             from two proofs back! (e.g. the deferred values)
           - The next step proof also computes the deferred values inside the circuit and verifies
             that they match those used by the previous wrap proof.

      The code below generates the deferred values so that we can verifiy that we can actually
      compute those values correctly inside the circuit.  Special thanks to Matthew Ryan for
      explaining this in detail. *)
