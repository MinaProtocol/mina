  (* Rebroadcast locally generated pool items every 10 minutes. Do so for 50
     minutes - at most 5 rebroadcasts - before giving up.

     The goal here is to be resilient to short term network failures and
     partitions. Note that with gossip we don't know anything about the state of
     other peers' pools (we know if something made it into a block, but that can
     take a long time and it's possible for things to be successfully received
     but never used in a block), so in a healthy network all repetition is spam.
     We need to balance reliability with efficiency. Exponential "backoff" would
     be better, but it'd complicate the interface between this module and the
     specific pool implementations.
