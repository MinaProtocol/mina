(** An interface to limited libp2p functionality for Coda to use.

A subprocess is spawned to run the go-libp2p code. This module communicates
with that subprocess over an ad-hoc RPC protocol.

TODO: separate internal helper errors from underlying libp2p errors.

In general, functions in this module return ['a Deferred.Or_error.t]. Unless
otherwise mentioned, the deferred is resolved immediately once the RPC action
to the libp2p helper is finished. Unless otherwise mentioned, everything can
throw an exception due to an internal helper error. These indicate a bug in
this module/the helper, and not misuse.

Some errors can arise from calling certain functions before [configure] has been
called. In general, anything that returns an [Or_error] can fail in this manner.

A [Coda_net2.t] has the following lifecycle:

- Fresh: the result of [Coda_net2.create]. This spawns the helper process but
  does not connect to any network. Few operations can be done on fresh nets,
  only [Keypair.random] for now.

- Configured: after calling [Coda_net2.configure]. Configure creates the libp2p
  objects and can start listening on network sockets. This doesn't join any DHT
  or attempt peer connections. Configured networks can do everything but any
  pubsub messages may have very limited reach without being in the DHT.

- Active: after calling [Coda_net2.begin_advertising]. This joins the DHT,
  announcing our existence to our peers and initiating local mDNS discovery.

- Closed: after calling [Coda_net2.shutdown]. This flushes all the pending RPC

TODO: consider encoding the network state in the types.

A note about connection limits:

In the original coda_net, connection limits were enforced synchronously on
every received connection. Right now with coda_net2, connection management is
asynchronous and post-hoc. In the background, once per minute it checks the
connection count. If it is above the "high water mark", it will close
("trim") eligible connections until it reaches the "low water mark". All
connections start with a "grace period" where they won't be closed. Peer IDs
can be marked as "protected" which prevents them being trimmed. Ember believes this
is vulnerable to resource exhaustion by opening many new connections.
