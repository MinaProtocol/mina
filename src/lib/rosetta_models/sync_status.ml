  ; (* synced is a boolean that indicates if an implementation has synced up to the most recent block. If this field is not populated, the caller should rely on a traditional tip timestamp comparison to determine if an implementation is synced.  This field is particularly useful for quiescent blockchains (blocks only produced when there are pending transactions). In these blockchains, the most recent block could have a timestamp far behind the current time but the node could be healthy and at tip.  *)
