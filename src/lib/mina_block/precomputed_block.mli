(** {1 Precomputed Blocks}

    A precomputed block is a fully processed Mina block that includes all the
    information needed to apply the block to the ledger and verify its validity.
    This is the "complete" representation of a block after all proofs have been
    generated and all state transitions computed.

    {2 What Makes It "Precomputed"?}

    In Mina's architecture, block production and proof generation can happen
    asynchronously. A precomputed block contains:
    1. The original block data (header + body)
    2. All zkSNARK proofs needed for validation
    3. Computed account state changes
    4. Token operation records

    {2 SNARK Workers and the Snarketplace}

    To maximize throughput, Mina separates block production from proof generation:
    - Block producers create blocks with transactions
    - SNARK workers generate the cryptographic proofs in parallel
    - The "Snarketplace" coordinates this work through economic incentives
    - Precomputed blocks represent the final result with all proofs included

    This design allows the network to process more transactions by parallelizing
    the computationally expensive proof generation.

(** {1 Proof Module}

    This module defines a specialized proof type with overridden
    base64-encoding.

    {2 Differences from standard `Mina_base.Proof.t`}
    - The base64-encoding implementation has been customized to align with Mina's
      cryptographic proof serialization format.
      Base64 with the uri-safe alphabet is used to ensure that encoding and
      decoding is cheap, and that the proof can be easily sent over http
      etc. without escaping or re-encoding.
    - This ensures that proofs can be efficiently serialized and deserialized
      within the Mina protocol while maintaining integrity and compatibility.

(** Convert a regular block into a precomputed block.

    This function takes a basic block and computes all the additional information
    needed for a precomputed block, including:
    - Determining which accounts were accessed or created
    - Recording token operations
    - Applying the staged ledger diff to compute state changes

    This is typically called after SNARK workers have generated the necessary
    proofs for the block's transactions. *)
