synopsis: "Shadowing interface to hide stdout output for passing tests"
description: "
Exposes the same interface as ppx_inline_test's runner, but caches the stdout
while tests are run and only outputs it at the end if there was a failure.

To use, simply `open Inline_test_quiet_logs` at the top of the file with the
inline tests to be silenced.
