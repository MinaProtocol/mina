The subdirectories of this directory, src/nonconsensus/, contain
symlinks to files in the corresponding directories in /src/lib/, so
that there's just one instance of each such file. Some of the
subdirectories may contain symlinks to fewer files than actual files
in the corresponding directories, because not all files are needed.

Each subdirectory contains its own dune file. The name of the library
created is suffixed with "_nonconsensus". In the "libraries" clause,
each named library must be a nonconsensus library, if available. Not
all libraries have a nonconsensus version; in that case, the usual
library may be mentioned.
