Introducing testnet-generic docker/debian packages instead of berkeley.

Historically berkeley artifacts were used for long runing pre hf testnet for experimenting with berkeley prior to hardfork event. After that we were still using them as genesis config for berkeley. The main reason to keep berkeley artifacts and still build them in CI, was not obvious. Since we didn't fork from berkeley , genesis config does not contain hard fork element, which is irreplaceable by chain of configs when running daemon, in contrary to devnet/mainnet. That would be fixed by full runtime config implementation, where we can replace every element of genesis config.

Replaces berkeley with something more clear as per usage and rename it to testnet-generic. We need testnet prefix to suggest it is incompatible with mainnet and generic since it is not connected to any network. By default seed list is targeted to devnet but there is no genesis config loaded behind the scenes. Therefore such artifacts can interact in any testnet network.

Another change this PR introduces is that we no longer adding genesis ledgers to every package variation (from network perspectvie). Mainnet to mainnet, devnet to devnet, testnet-generic got devnet.

Also we are not adding magic config to testnet generic
