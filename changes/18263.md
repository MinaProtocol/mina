- Added a filesystem hint at /etc/coda/build_config/PROFILE.
This file provides the information the node uses to determine which configuration profile to load at startup.

- Added support for selecting the node configuration profile at runtime via the MINA_PROFILE environment variable.
Supported values are: dev, devnet, lightnet, and mainnet.

  This allows an operator to run, for example, a devnet build artifact with MINA_PROFILE=mainnet, with proper genesis ledgers provided in CLI arg, this could cause the node to behave as a mainnet node.

  Note: This feature is intended for advanced usage and should be used with care.
