# PR #16499 Decouple Transaction_snark_work.{Stable.Latest.t, t}

## Summary

Make `Transaction_snark_work.Stable.Latest.t` and `Transaction_snark_work.t` be defined separately.

## Impact

This allows for `Transaction_snark_work.t` to include data that can't be serialized.

We'll use it in latter PR to integrate on-disk cache, which is part of RAM optimizations effort.
