# PR 16722 [WASM Memory boosting mode with lazy cache](https://github.com/o1-labs/o1js/issues/2075)

## Summary

`mina` counterpart of the lazy mode meant to trade prover time for memory to 
save WASM space. This PR updates the types to be compatible with an additional
flag `lazy_mode: bool` across the index creation algorithms.

## Changes
- Add `lazy_mode` flag in index creation functions of Pickles and js bindings 
(defaults to `false` for the non-lazy previous behaviour)
- Bumps `proof-systems` submodule to the commit of the counterpart 
[PR](https://github.com/o1-labs/proof-systems/pull/3079) where the lazy 
computation behaviour is handled at the SNARK level.

## Impact
Allows to trade prover time for memory space at the setup phase. The final goal
is to reduce the WASM memory usage to allow for space-demanding features like
chunking from o1js.

## Invariant Assumption: 
- Assumes the default behaviour is desired to be as before these changes, that
means the lazy mode is `false` if not passed as an additional parameter of some
functions.
- Assumes that setting the flag to `true` will bring some gains in WASM memory.
