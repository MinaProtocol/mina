## Abstract
Updated SNARK worker protocol. Now more parallelism can be utilized when constructing proofs for a zkApp command. Redeployment of SNARK worker and SNARK coordinator(i.e. any daemon that's attached to a SNARK worker) would be needed for this to take effect. 

## Metrics
The metrics related to SNARK workers has been updated as well.

Following metrics are maintained by the worker:
- `snark_worker_sub_zkapp_command_segment_time`
- `snark_worker_sub_zkapp_command_merge_time`
- `snark_worker_merge_time`
- `snark_worker_nonzkapp_transition_time`

addtionally, the coordinator maintains all metrics above, plus an extra metric:
- `snark_worker_zkapp_transition_time`

While having same name, these shared metrics have different meanings across coordinator and worker: Any time tracked by a worker represents the time this specific worker spent on that genre, while any time tracked by a coordinator represents the sum of time any worker attached to that coordinator spent on that genre.

This is part of the Slot Reduction MIP from Mesa Hardfork.
