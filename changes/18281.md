- store `hash` field of in-memory type for `Transaction_with_witness`
- store `hash` field of in-memory type for `Ledger_proof_with_sok_message`
- use stored `hash` fields in computation of scan state hash from in-memory types
- use hash methods in computation of scan state hash from `Stable` types (instead of splicing in `string` values)
