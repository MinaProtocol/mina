# PR 16798: kimchi-stubs: use core instead of std

This is part of an outgoing work reg. the bump to Rust 1.82 and lowering the
dependencies we use in our Rust codebase.

This is mostly a no-op as `std` re-exports `core`. However, it seems to be a
good-practice, in the Rust community, to use the later.
