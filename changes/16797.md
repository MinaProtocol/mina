# PR 16797: plonk-wasm: remove unused proc-macros2 deps

## Summary

Title is self descriptive.
The dependency was also causing some development overhead when we wanted to
update the Rust version because of its strict equality requirement.

This work is part of the effort regarding the bump up of Rust to 1.82, and at
the same time, simplifying how we manage Rust dependencies.
