RAM optimization: use disk cache to store proofs from zkapp transactions and
complete works. In RAM proofs are replaced with integer tags that refer to an
entry in LMDB database which stores actual proof bytes. This optimization caps
RAM usage of Mina node even under high transaction loads at a much lower value
than was achieved before (precise number to be comnfirmed from experiments that
will follow).
