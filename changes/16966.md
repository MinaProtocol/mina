RAM optimization: use disk cache to store proofs from zkapp transactions and complete works. In RAM proofs are replaced with integer tags that refer to an entry in LMDB database which stores actual proof bytes. This optimization caps RAM usage of Mina node even under high transaction loads at a much lower value than was achieved before (precise number to be comnfirmed from experiments that will follow).
