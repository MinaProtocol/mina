# PR 16856 Cargo: enforce some versions previously used by succesful builds on o1js

## Summary

This patch updates to a version of proof-systems that enforces strict versions
on dependencies used by `plonk-wasm`, the Rust library compiled to WebAssembly
and used by o1js.

The versions are the ones that have been used by a previously successful build
for o1js.

## Changes

- Enforces the following strict constraints:
  - getrandom -> 0.2.15
  - js-sys -> 0.3.64
  - libc -> 0.2.169
  - once_cell -> 1.20.3
  - paste -> 1.0.15
  - rand -> 0.8.5
  - rayon -> 1.10.0
  - rmp-serde -> 1.2.0
  - serde -> 1.0.219
  - serde_json -> 1.0.109
  - serde-wasm-bindgen -> 0.6.5
  - spmc -> 0.3.0
  - web-sys -> 0.3.64

In addition to updating proof-systems to the patch enforcing these constraints,
kimchi-stubs-vendors is updated accordingly to reflect these changes for the
native build.

## Impact

This patch allows the o1js constributors to start building on top of
proof-systems.
