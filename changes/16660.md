# PR #16660 Add Mina_block.Stable.Latest.transactions

## Summary

Introduce `transactions` function for `Mina_block`'s stable type.

Implementation doesn't rely on `Stable.Latest.t = t`, which is useful to utilize the new `transactions` function after we break the equality in #16496.


# Impact

This is a step towards using cache for every occassion of `Ledger_proof.t`. Which is in turn part of RAM optimization package.
