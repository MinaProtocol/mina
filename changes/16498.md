# PR #16498 Decouple Staged_ledger_diff.{Stable.Latest.t, t}

## Summary

Make `Staged_ledger_diff.Stable.Latest.t` and `Staged_ledger_diff.t` be defined separately.

## Impact

This allows for `Staged_ledger_diff.t` to include data that can't be serialized.

We'll use it in latter PR to integrate on-disk cache, which is part of RAM optimizations effort.
