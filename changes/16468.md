Optimizing archive node genesis account function. Function tries to inserts all accounts from genesis ledger config file. However, it does it in non optimal way. Namely it open transaction at start then tries to add all accounts in one go and finally commits. This can lead to OutOfMemory issues for postgres process since  mainnet genesis ledger contains 200k+ accounts. We experienced that problem on our performance environment. Solution is to make more granular commits during import. New code chop account to be inserted list into 100 account batches (this is measured value as 500 was also making postgres memory increase till 40~gb)
