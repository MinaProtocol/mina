# PR #16715 [Archive single node test] mina automation test runners

Helpers for new kind of tests which have a common setup in tear down. For example in single archive node tests we will have a very same setup (bootstrapping archive on db) and teardown (killing process). Thanks to that addition we can focus only on test logic in test library leaving rest for Fixture module in mina automation library
