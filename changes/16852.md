# PR #16852 Split User_command's stable and regular types

## Summary

Decouple user command's `Stable.Latest.t` and `t` types.

Plus: define `read_all_proofs_from_disk` and `write_all_proofs_to_disk` as `Fn.id` in `zkapp_command.ml`
and use these definitions in all of the types that depend on `Zkapp_command.t`.

## Impact

Allows transaction's type to contain on-disk-cache refences. A step toward larger RAM optimization effort.
