# PR 16791: Bump up proof systems to include Rust 1.82 support

## Summary

An outgoing effort is happening to support Rust 1.82 in Mina.
Previously, some PR on the proof-systems side
(https://github.com/o1-labs/proof-systems/pull/3089,
https://github.com/o1-labs/proof-systems/pull/3090) have been merged in master
to provide a support for Rust 1.82 in this dependency.

In addition to that, the same work happened for
[ocaml-gen](https://github.com/o1-labs/ocaml-gen) :
https://github.com/o1-labs/ocaml-gen/pull/29 and
https://github.com/o1-labs/ocaml-gen/pull/31.

This PR updates the git submodule pointing to proof-systems to the commits
including these changes (103901a6a5b91988ffb537fc811a0354f259c20e).

`cargo vendor` is also run to update the dependencies of proof-systems vendored
in https://github.com/o1-labs/proof-systems-vendors - counterparty PR is
https://github.com/o1-labs/proof-systems-vendors/pull/4.
