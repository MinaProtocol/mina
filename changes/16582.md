# PR #16582 Use disk cache for complete works held in blocks

All complete works held in blocks (that are being processed and stored in transition frontier) will become references to disk cache.

This is an important step in larger RAM optimization effort.

## Implementation note

Make `Transaction_snark_work.t` use `Ledger_proof.Cached.t` under the hood.
Including snark works that form staged ledger diff.
