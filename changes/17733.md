Mesa upgrade archive script + rollback.

Script is adding new tables to zkapps_state_nullable:

- Columns element8 till element31.
- Introducing new table version, to track what is the schema version. It should help in future debugging as knowledge if upgrade script was ran or not would be very useful

Script is meant to run multiple times on live archive db. This is done by  short locking mechanism and tx rollback. Also it does check what is current state of db before doing any modifications.
In addition I've added rollback script, just in case of undetected issue in our testing.
