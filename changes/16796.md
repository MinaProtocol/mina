PR "Refactor Common module in verifier" aims to enhance the verifier component of the Mina Protocol by restructuring the Common module. This refactoring involves reorganizing existing code to improve maintainability, readability, and efficiency without altering the module's external behavior. The changes include simplifying complex functions, removing redundant code, and better organizing the module's structure. These improvements are expected to facilitate future development and reduce the potential for errors in the verifier component.
