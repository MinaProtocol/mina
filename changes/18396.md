The fork_config graphql field at the daemon now returns the scheduled hard fork slot and timestamp in the config that it generates, if the daemon has its stop slots and hard fork genesis delta config values set. If these are not set, it will return the timestamp and slot of the hard fork block itself as a fallback.
