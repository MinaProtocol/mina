The daemon will now skip attempting to clean up old `libp2p_helper` processes that have not exited, as the existing scheme to do this could accidentally kill unrelated processes. The `libp2p_helper` is designed to exit promptly when the daemon exits for any reason, so this will not affect daemon operation in practice.
