Fixes for rosetta LIMIT and OFFSET parameters. The root of the issue is imperfect deduct of offset/limit during fetch of user_command, internal_commands and zkapp command separately from db. Offset and limit is used separately for each type of commands mapping postgres OFFSET and LIMIT commands not for overall txs. The solution is to deduct offset from total user command while limit only by returned user commands .
