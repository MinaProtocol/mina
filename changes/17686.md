GraphQL query `daemonStatus` will now report SNARK worker zkApp/non-zkApp transition time separately. Previous field `snarkWorkerTransitionTime` was replaced with fields `snarkWorkerZkappTransitionTime` and `snarkWorkerNonzkappTransitionTime`.
Similarly, output of `mina client status --performance` will display these two metrics separately.
