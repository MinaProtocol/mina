(** Mina: all library layers and product executables.

    Layers group related libraries by domain.
    Products correspond to application executables in src/app.

    All targets are registered at module load time via top-level
    declarations in each layer and product module. This file exists
    only to satisfy the module list in manifest/dune. *)
