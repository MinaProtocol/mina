#!/bin/bash

# This script checks if a changelog entry is required for a given pull request.
# It compares the current commit with the base branch of the pull request and looks for changes
# in the specified trigger files. If changes are found, it checks if the required changelog entry
# is present. If not, it exits with an error. Can be bypassed by a !ci-bypass-changelog comment.

# Usage:
#   ./changelog.sh --path <path> --changelog-file <changelog-file>
#
# Options:
#   --path: Filepath for which to check the diff
#   --changelog-file: Location of changelog file (should be present if diff is non-empty)
#   -h, --help: Display help message
#
# Example:
#   ./changelog.sh --path 'src/daemon' --changelog-file 'changes/1234-new-feature.md'
