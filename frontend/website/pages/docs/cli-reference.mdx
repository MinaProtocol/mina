# CLI Reference

The Coda CLI (command-line interface) is the primary way for users to interact with the Coda network. It provides standard client functionality to create accounts, send transactions, and participate in consensus. There are also advanced client and daemon commands for power users.

The CLI is installed when you [install coda](/docs/getting-started#installation).

<Alert kind="warning">

Coda APIs are still under construction, so these commands will likely change. See `coda help` for the most up-to-date version.

Coda daemon

  coda.exe daemon 

=== flags ===

  [-archive-address HOST:PORT/LOCALHOST-PORT]  Daemon to archive process
                                               communication. If HOST is
                                               omitted, then localhost is
                                               assumed to be HOST. (examples:
                                               3086, 154.97.53.97:3086)
  [-archive-rocksdb]                           Stores all the blocks heard in
                                               RocksDB
  [-background]                                Run process on the background
  [-bind-ip IP]                                IP of network interface to use
                                               for peer connections
  [-block-producer-key KEYFILE]                Private key file for the block
                                               producer. You cannot provide both
                                               `block-producer-key` and
                                               `block-producer-pubkey`.
                                               (default: don't produce blocks)
  [-block-producer-password PASSWORD]          Password associated with the
                                               block-producer key. Setting this
                                               is equivalent to setting the
                                               CODA_PRIVKEY_PASS environment
                                               variable. Be careful when setting
                                               it in the commandline as it will
                                               likely get tracked in your
                                               history. Mainly to be used from

  [-block-producer-pubkey PUBLICKEY]           Public key for the associated

                                               by this daemon. You cannot
                                               provide both `block-producer-key`
                                               and `block-producer-pubkey`.
                                               (default: don't produce blocks)
  [-client-port PORT]                          local RPC-server for clients to

                                               blocks). If not provided,
                                               coinbase rewards will be sent to
                                               the producer of a block.

  [-discovery-keypair KEYFILE]                 Keypair (generated from `coda

                                               need to set this if
