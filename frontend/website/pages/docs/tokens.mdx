# Tokens

In the Coda protocol, users can create their own Tokens which can be minted (or created) and sent by using special token accounts. The Coda CLI (command-line interface) is the primary way to interact with tokens on the Coda blockchain. It provides a client interface that supports functionality to create new tokens, create new token accounts, and mint non-default tokens. In addition to the tokens interface, there are other advanced client and daemon commands (see [CLI Reference](/docs/cli-reference#cli-reference)).

## Creating Tokens

With the CLI, you are able to create your own tokens on Coda. Non-default tokens are a new type of token that is introduced to the Coda blockchain. These new types of tokens have a unique identifier that differentiate them from all other tokens in the blockchain. Users with an associated token account can then receive/send this new type of token that is totally separate from the native Coda token itself! When you create a new token, you are then able to mint more of the token to be used (see below in [Minting Tokens](/docs/tokens#minting-tokens)).

When creating a new token, a new token ID is created as well as a token account for your public key. This token account owns the token and can mint more of the token. The account will also (eventually) have the power to enable/disable accounts, and to set whether new accounts may be created for the token.

Please note that creating new tokens requires an additional fee on top of the ever-present transaction fee. This additional fee is the fee that must be paid when creating a new token account. This means there is a fee for the account creation on top of the transaction fee that is normally applied.

### Create a new token

```
$ coda client create-token -sender <PUBLIC_KEY>
```

<Alert>


The required field for creating a new token account is:

- -**sender** : The public key from which you want to send the transaction

</Alert>


See

```
$ coda client create-token -help
```

to learn more about how to use the command.

## Creating Token Accounts

With the CLI, you are able to create a token account for existing tokens. Token accounts are like regular accounts but solely meant to interact with the non-default tokens that exist in the Coda protocol. You must create a separate unique token account for each type of token you wish to interact with.

<Alert kind="warning">


To send or receive an existing token, you must have a token account with the specified token. If there is no valid token account with the token, the transaction will fail.

</Alert>


### Create a new token account

```
$ coda client create-token-account -token-owner <PUBLICKEY> -receiver <PUBLICKEY> -sender <KEY> -token <TOKEN_ID>
```

<Alert>


If the token owner is not given, the CLI will query to find the token owner. If no owner is found, the command will fail with an error.

The required fields for creating a new token account are:

- -**receiver** : The public key to create the new account for, you can reuse your normal public key here

- -**sender** : Public key from which you want to send the transaction

- -**token** : The ID of the token from which you want to send the transaction

</Alert>


See

```
$ coda client create-token-account -help
```

to learn more about how to use the command.

## Minting Tokens

With the CLI, you are able to mint your own tokens. Minting your own tokens simply increases the supply of a particular token. Minting tokens is how all non-default tokens are created, there are no other protocol-events or commands that can create non-default tokens. This command may only be issued by the token owner, but the tokens may be minted in any existing account for that token.

### Mint a token

```
$ coda client mint-tokens -amount <VALUE> -sender <PUBLIC-KEY> -token <TOKEN_ID>
```

<Alert>


The required fields for creating a new token account are:

- -**amount** : Number of new tokens to create

- -**sender** : Public key from which you want to send the transaction

- -**token** : The ID of the token to mint

There is also an optional field that lets you specify the public key of the account to create the new tokens in:

- -**receiver** : Public key of the account to create new tokens in

</Alert>


See

```
$ coda client mint-tokens -help
```

to learn more about how to use the command.

## Example

Let's now combine all the commands above to send a transaction with a newly minted token. First, make sure that you have your public key set in an environment such as:

```
$ export CODA_PUBLIC_KEY=<YOUR-PUBLIC-KEY>
```

### Create a new token

First, you'll want to create a new token type. Note that when you are the creator of a new token, you have a token-account created for you automatically.

```
$ coda client create-token -sender $CODA_PUBLIC_KEY
```

After your command gets accepted into the block chain, let's identify what the token ID is for your newly created token.

```
$ coda client get-tokens -public-key $CODA_PUBLIC_KEY
```

We should get a response that looks like the following:

```
Accounts are held for token IDs:
1 2
```

Currently, we use integers to represent new token IDs when they are created. The default Coda token has a token ID of 1 and the newly created token has an ID of 2. This will most likely be different when you create a new token.

Let's save our new token ID into an environment variable like so:

```
$ export TOKENID=2
```

### Mint your new token

Now let's mint more tokens. To do so, we use the command:

```
$ coda client mint-tokens -amount 5 -sender $CODA_PUBLIC_KEY -token $TOKENID
```

This creates 5 new tokens of our newly created token. To check your balance, use the following:

```
$ coda client get-balance -public-key $CODA_PUBLIC_KEY -token $TOKENID
```

### Send your new token

Finally, lets send a transaction. Make sure you have a receiver public-key available for which you want to send to. Then use the following:

```
$ coda client send-payment \
  -amount 5 \
  -receiver <PUBLIC-KEY-TO-SEND-TO> \
  -fee 2 \
  -sender $CODA_PUBLIC_KEY \
  -token $TOKENID
```

Viola! We have now successfully created, minted, and sent a new token to another user. Please note that if you want to receive a new token for which you haven't created, you must create a token-account for that specific token. You can do that with the following command:

```
$ coda client create-token-account -receiver $CODA_PUBLIC_KEY -sender $CODA_PUBLIC_KEY -token <TOKEN-ID-YOU-WANT-ACCOUNT-FOR>
```
