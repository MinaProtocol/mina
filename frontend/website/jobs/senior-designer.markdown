## About us

O(1) Labs is aiming to develop the first cryptocurrency protocol that can deliver on the promise of supporting real-world applications and widespread use. Our team is based in San Francisco, and we are funded by top investors (including Polychain, Metastable, Max Levchin, and Naval Ravikant).

We’re bringing Coda Protocol to market, a cryptocurrency that compresses the blockchain from hundreds of gigabytes down to the size of a few tweets. It can scale to thousands of transactions per second and millions of users while remaining decentralized enough for cellphones to be fully verifying nodes.

This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems that span cryptography, engineering, product design, economics, and sociology. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.

If you’d be interested in talking further, please get in touch by
sending an email with your resume, link to your portfolio, and the subject “Senior Designer
Applicant” to [jobs@o1labs.org](mailto:jobs@o1labs.org?subject="Senior Designer Applicant"). A portfolio is required to be considered for this role.

We are committed to building a diverse, inclusive company. People of
color, LGBTQ individuals, women, and people with disabilities are
strongly encouraged to apply.
