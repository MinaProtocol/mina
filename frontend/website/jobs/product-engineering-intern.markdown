Help us build accessible, usable, delightful products on top of the Coda Cryptocurrency Protocol!

We’re seeking a frontend product engineering intern who is also excited by building beautiful products. While it's hard to say exactly what project you'll work on given that we are such an early-stage startup, some example intern projects could include:

- Introducing a novel, simple, account recovery mechanism to wallet software
- Building an imaginative cryptocurrency application from start to finish that showcases what’s possible with a succinct blockchain
- Adding autocomplete or syntax highlighting or collaborative editing to an in-browser Coda IDE

- Exposure to a declarative frontend framework, such as React, Angular, Vue, Elm etc.
    - Bonus for experience with React Hooks or GraphQL
- Willingness to work on-site in a San Francisco based office

## Grab Bag (at least one of the following)

- Familiarity with functional programming, know your way around map and reduce.
- CSS chops, should be comfortable with Flexbox.
- Experience working on multiple collaborative projects with a product team containing at least one additional developer or designer (or larger team-based projects at university or a bootcamp program).
- Exposure to working with cryptocurrencies
- Experience with ReasonML, OCaml, Elm, or Purescript
- Early stage startup experience
- Experience with contributing to Open Source

## About us

O(1) Labs is aiming to develop the first cryptocurrency protocol that can deliver on the promise of supporting real-world applications and widespread use. Our team is based in San Francisco, and we are funded by top investors (including Polychain, Metastable, Max Levchin, and Naval Ravikant).

We’re bringing Coda Protocol to market, a cryptocurrency that compresses the blockchain from hundreds of gigabytes down to the size of a few tweets. It can scale to thousands of transactions per second and millions of users while remaining decentralized enough for cellphones to be fully verifying nodes.

We’re working on technologies with the potential to reimagine social structures. We believe it’s important to incorporate diverse perspectives from conception through realization.

This is a chance to join a small, collaborative team and have a ton of independence while working on fascinating cross-disciplinary problems that span cryptography, engineering, product design, economics, and sociology. We also offer competitive compensation both in salary and equity as well as top-of-the-market benefits.

We are committed to building a diverse, inclusive company. People of color, LGBTQ individuals, women, and people with disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply.
