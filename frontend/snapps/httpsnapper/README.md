# TSDX User Guide

Congrats! You just saved yourself hours of work by bootstrapping this project with TSDX. Let’s get you oriented with what’s here and how to use it.

> This TSDX setup is meant for developing libraries (not apps!) that can be published to NPM. If you’re looking to build a Node app, you could use `ts-node-dev`, plain `ts-node`, or simple `tsc`.

> If you’re new to TypeScript, checkout [this handy cheatsheet](https://devhints.io/typescript)

## Commands

TSDX scaffolds your new library inside `/src`.

To run TSDX, use:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.

### Jest

Jest tests are set up to run with `npm test` or `yarn test`.

### Bundle Analysis

[`size-limit`](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) is set up to calculate the real cost of your library with `npm run size` and visualize the bundle with `npm run analyze`.

#### Setup Files
