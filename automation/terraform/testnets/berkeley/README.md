# Berkeley Testnet deployment

The QA-net for zkapps is called `berkeley`, by decision of the Node Working Group, and runs an image from `develop` which is the branch all zkapps related PRs for the protocol are based off of and merged to

Setup for deploying the testnet

1. Firstly one needs to obtain the keys of all the nodes within the testnet, and place those keys within `automation/keys`.  This `keys` directory should be obtained from whoever has them- this is just a testnet so the keys don't control real money but they still are private keys.  The structure of `automation/keys` is as follows:
```
.
├── genesis
├── keypairs
├── keysets
├── libp2p
└── testnet-keys
```
`genesis` and `keypairs` is usually empty.  `testnet-keys` contains directories full of private keys, each directory in `testnet-keys` will be named `<testnet>_*`, so in this case they are named `berkeley_*`.  `keysets` contains files prefixed with the testnet name which contains sets of public keys of each class (seed, fish, whales, etc).  `lip2p` contains directories named after the testnet, where each directory contains a list of the libp2p keys of all the online nodes, all in one place (although the libp2p keys are also in `testnet-keys`).

2. IF in `main.tf` the variable `use_embedded_runtime_config` is set to false, THEN make sure there is a genesis_ledger.json file in `automation/terraform/testnets/berkeley` (terraform apply will upload this genesis_ledger.json as a config-map and automatically hook it up to the daemons).  Make sure that the timestamp within this file is within the last 14 days, if the timestamp is older than 14 days then manually edit the date to be any time within 14 days.  Make sure the timestamp is in UTC format (hint: it should end with a `Z`).  On the other hand, if `use_embedded_runtime_config` is set to true, then the nodes will use whatever genesis ledger is baked into the docker image that you specify in step #3, and therefore no config-map upload of any genesis ledger json file is necessary.  As of 2022/03, buildkite CI will automatically build berkeley docker images, simply select one off of a good branch.  If you would like to manually create your own image, you can run `./automation/scripts/bake.sh --testnet=test-snapps --cloud=false --docker-tag=<tag_of_existing_docker_image_to_use_as_base>`

3. In main.tf update `mina_image` and `mina_archive_image` to be a recent image created by our CI from the relevant branch.  If you prefer to use an image you baked in step #2 instead, then use that baked image for `mina_image`; note that this image needs to be uploaded somewhere, GCR or dockerhub, and cannot be simply a local image.

4. The test-snapps testnet is currently configured to have 16 whales online (plus another 4 that we could bring online), 2 online fish, 3 seed, 1 snark coordinator with 5 workers connected to it, and 3 archive processes writing to two postgres database (main.tf has these specifications). As long as the keys for these nodes are in `automation/keys`, then the keys will be added and uploaded automatically by terraform.

5. If the `test-snapps` is already running then destroy it by running `terraform destroy --auto-approve` from the directory `automation/terraform/testnets/test-snapps/`. If running for the first time, then run `terraform init`
Note: You may have to set the env variable `KUBE_CONFIG=~/.kube/config `

6. Deploy the network by running `terraform apply --auto-approve` from `automation/terraform/testnets/test-snapps/`.  If `automation/keys` already exists with all the folders and files with the `berkeley_*` prefix, then those keys will be used.  If those folders and files do not exist, then terraform will run the script `automation/scripts/generate-keys-and-ledger.sh`, and arbitrary completely new keys will be generated, along with a new genesis ledger.

7. Wait for all the nodes to come up and monitor the network on grafana https://o1testnet.grafana.net/
