# Repository Purpose

This repository is designed to show an opinionated example on how to operate a network of Coda Daemons. It implements the entire node lifecycle using a modern Infrastructure as Code toolset. Community contributions are warmly encouraged, please see the [contribution guidelines](#to-do) for more details. The code is designed to be as modular as possible, allowing the end-user to "pick and choose" the parts they would like to incorporate into their own infrastructure stack.

If you have any issues setting up your testnet or have any other questions about this repository, join the public [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ShKhA7J) and get help from the Coda community.

# What is a Testnet

A Testnet (a.k.a. Test Network) is a tool that is used to "test" Coda's distributed software. Our testnets are designed to simulate a "Mainnet" environment in order to identify bugs and test new functionality. Along with the network itself, there are several bots and services that are additionally deployed to facilitate a baseline of activity and access to the network.

# Components of a Testnet

### Whale and Fish Block Producers

In order to simulate a differentiation between O(1) Stake (Whales) and end-user stake (Fish), the testnets adhere to a simple naming scheme to differentiate between the two. In order to facilitate this, additional configuration must be made in the ledger, allocating a large amount of stake to "Whale Block Producers" and a lesser amount to "Fish Block Producers".

### Bots

Bots are often used to automate transactions being sent around the network. Often, these require special consideration in the genesis ledger, so it's worth keeping them in mind when setting up a new network. For example, the O(1) Discord Faucet is a simple sidecar bot that runs against a Coda Daemon's GraphQL Port and responds to requests for funds in the Coda Protocol Discord server.

### Services

Like bots, there are other blockchain-aware services that are deployed but might not need special consideration or stake. Two good examples of this are the Archive Node and the GraphQL Proxy.

### Ledger

The ledger is arguably the most important thing to get right, because this single point of failure can bork an entire deployment. There are several key points that have to be configured correctly for a network to bootstrap as expected:

- Offline keys delegated to online keys
- Proper balances and currency encoding
- Proper formatting of ledger itself

## QA Testnet

QA Testnets are designed to be run internally to support feature development and bug triage. Seed nodes are launched in Kubernetes with cluster-local DNS.

## Public Testnet

Public Testnets are functionally similar to QA Testnets but have the addition of "public" seed nodes with static IP addresses. This is required due to the necessarily dynamic nature of Kubernetes, so these public seeds are launched via Google Compute Engine VMs.

# Deploy a QA Testnet

Deploying a testnet is a relatively straightforward process once you have ironed out the configuration. At a high level, there are several pieces of configuration it's important to keep in mind or else your deployment might fail:

- Coda Keypairs
- Genesis Ledger
- Runtime Constants

### Clone the Repository

(If you are reading this locally, good job!)

### Apply the Infrastructure Module (If deploying infrastructure completely from scratch)

Most developers shouldn't have to worry about this, however it's worth noting that the entire infrastructure can be deployed from scratch by running `terraform init && terraform apply` in `terraform/infrastructure`.

If you don't know if you _should_ do this, you probably shouldn't!

### Create a Testnet

### Quick steps to launch a small network

1) make a new `terraform/testnets/<testnet>`
2) `./scripts/generate-keys-and-ledger.sh --testnet=<testnet> --wc=10 --fc=10`
3) run `./scripts/bake.sh --testnet=<testnet> --docker-tag=<tag, ex. 0.0.17-beta6-develop> --automation-commit=$(git log -1 --pretty=format:%H) --cloud=true`
4) copy the image tag from the output of bake.sh to `coda_image` in `terraform/testnets/<testnet>/main.tf`
5) set the archive image tag to the corresponding tag name - for example, if the image is `0.0.17-beta10-880882e`, use  `gcr.io/o1labs-192920/coda-archive:0.0.17-beta10-880882e`
6) run `terraform apply`
7) after its done applying, run `./scripts/upload-keys-k8s.sh <testnet>`

For a public network, add on

8) run `python3 scripts/get_peers.py <testnet>`
9) run `scripts/upload_cloud_bake_to_docker.sh --testnet=<TESTNET> --docker-tag=<tag> --automation-commit=<automation commit>`

### Creating the Testnet directory

Next, you must create a new testnet in `terraform/testnets/`. For ease of use, you can copy-paste an existing one, however it's important to go through the terraform and change the following things:

- location of Terraform state file
- Name of testnet
- number of nodes to deploy
- Location of the Genesis Ledger
- Kubernetes [context](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/coda-automation/commit/141db8821a133501d3d4ed9b739fcad1f9b88bef) for indicating which managed *k8s* cluster to deploy to

### Manage *k8s* Cluster for Deployment

Prior to deploying, reference your Kubernetes cloud provider for proper configuration of a Kubernetes cluster/context or reach out to #reliability-engineering within the `Mina Protocol` Discord server for guidance on internal engineering deployments.

The following *Kubernetes* cluster contexts are maintained by O(1) Lab's infrastructure team:

Cluster Name | Cluster Context | GCP/GKE *Kubernetes* Provider Region
--- | --- | ---
coda-infra-east | gke_o1labs-192920_us-east1_coda-infra-east | `us-east1` 
coda-infra-east4 | gke_o1labs-192920_us-east4_coda-infra-east4 | `us-east4` 
coda-infra-central1 | gke_o1labs-192920_us-central1_coda-infra-central1 | `us-central1` 
mina-integration-west1 | gke_o1labs-192920_us-west1_mina-integration-west1 | `us-west1` 

#### Obtain credentials for a Kubernetes context

Once decided on a cluster/context to deploy, use the following command to retrieve the appropriate cluster credentials:

`gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --region <cluster-region> --project o1labs-192920`

#### Set active cluster/context within deploy environment

`kubectl config use-context <cluster-context>`

#### Configure testnet module `k8s_context`

There is a testnet module variable which determines the *Kubernetes* context to deploy to. Reference the module's [variable definitions](https://github.com/MinaProtocol/coda-automation/blob/master/terraform/modules/kubernetes/testnet/variables.tf) for more details on how to properly configure.

```variable "k8s_context" {
  type = string

  description = "K8s resource provider context"
  default     = "gke_o1labs-192920_us-east1_coda-infra-east"
}```

#### Set Terraform Kubernetes provider configuration path

In order for Terraform to locate and identify the configured Kubernetes contexts, it is expected that the `KUBE_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is set to the operator's Kubernetes configuration file (generally found at *~/.kube/config*). Be sure to run this step prior to attempting to execute any `terraform` commands on a testnet. See [here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/kubernetes/latest/docs#config_paths) for more details.

```
export KUBE_CONFIG_PATH=~/.kube/config
}```

### Generate Keys and Genesis Ledger

The script `scripts/generate-keys-and-ledger.sh` handles key and genesis ledger generation. This script will build keysets and public/private key files to the output path in `./keys/keysets` and `keys/testnet-keys`.
It is necessary to set the number of whales, fish, and extra-fish. The testnet name will specify the genesis ledger output folder for daemon consumption. `terraform/tests/TESTNET/`
You will need to have compiled coda-network to the `bin/`

```
./scripts/generate-keys-and-ledger.sh --testnet=beans --wc=5 --fc=1 --efc=2

Options:
  --testnet=STRING     Name of the testnet which keys are being generated for.
  --wc=INTEGER         Number of Whale Account keys to generate.
  --fc=INTEGER         Number of Fish Account keys to generate.
  --efc=INTEGER        Number of extra Fish keys to generate.
  --reset=true|false   Boolean to force regeneration of keys. Default is false
```

### Bake Script

The bake script allows you to bundle keys and genesis ledger pre baked into the container with the latest mina daemon. It does this by pulling the genesis ledger from github specified by the automation commit and the testnet name. Therefore to use the script the genesis ledger must be pushed to github at the correct commit. The cloud flag can be set to true to build via GCP's cloud build functionality.

```
./scripts/bake.sh --testnet=nightly --docker-tag=0.0.17-beta6-develop --automation-commit=$(git log -1 --pretty=format:%H) --cloud=true

Options:
  --testnet=STRING            Name of the testnet.
  --docker-tag=STRING         Docker tag for the mina daemon repository.
  --automation-commit=STRING  Specifying commit for coda-automation.
  --cloud=true|false          Should docker be built in cloud or locally.
```

### Autodeploy.sh

Assuming the hard task of configuration has been completed without error, this script will make your deployment experience a _breeze_.

This script will do the following:

- Attempt to tear down (aka "destroy") the existing testnet, should it exist
- Deploy anew the testnet as defined in the previous section
- Upload the keys you generated to Kubernetes as Secrets for use at runtime

Note: The deployment of keys relies on kubectl being properly configured for the cluster you are deploying to!

```
./scripts/auto-deploy.sh <testnet>
```

### Upload Secrets script
`scripts/upload-keys-k8s.sh` is responsible for uploading the whale, fish, bots, and discord keys as secrets to kubernetes for a given testnet name. It assumes that the keys are specified at `keys/testnet-keys`. If the keys were generated with `generate-keys-and-ledger.sh` and not changed or moved you can leave `$KEYS_PREFIX` blank

```
  scripts/upload-keys-k8s.sh $TESTNET_NAME $KEYS_PREFIX
```

### Is it Working?

#### Logs

Logs will be persisted in StackDriver for any container deployment.

**Example Queries:**

Get all logs from `fish-block-producer-1` in the `<testnet>` namespace.

```
resource.type="k8s_container"
resource.labels.project_id="o1labs-192920"
resource.labels.location="us-east1"
resource.labels.cluster_name="coda-infra-east"
resource.labels.namespace_name="<testnet>"
labels.k8s-pod/app="fish-block-producer-1"
```

Get all logs from any Block Producer (note the `:` instead of `=` in `labels.k8s-pod/app:"block-producer"`!):

```
resource.type="k8s_container"
resource.labels.project_id="o1labs-192920"
resource.labels.location="us-east1"
resource.labels.cluster_name="coda-infra-east"
resource.labels.namespace_name="<testnet>"
labels.k8s-pod/app:"block-producer"
```

#### Dashboards

There are several public Grafana dashboards available here:

- [Network Overview](https://o1testnet.grafana.net/d/qx4y6dfWz/network-overview?orgId=1)
- [Block Producer](https://o1testnet.grafana.net/d/Rgo87HhWz/block-producer-dashboard?orgId=1&refresh=1m)
- [SNARK Worker](https://o1testnet.grafana.net/d/scQUGOhWk/snark-worker-dashboard?orgId=1&refresh=1m)

# Deploy a Public Testnet

### Bkase's memory of deploys as of 9/16

0. Commit to master
1. git tag 0.0.16-beta4 (with -m or it won't work) (increment the 4 every time)
2. push the tag
3. Push the master
4. curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Circle-Token: 62bcf7b6c8ef60bdee3ecb3618d530e5f77eb78e" -d '{ "branch": "master", "parameters": { "run-ci": true } }' 'https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/github/CodaProtocol/coda/pipeline'
   (this starts the build)
5. In coda automation, unzip the 3.3-keys.tar.gz into coda-automation
6. Download secrets for gogoel cloud storage -- scripts/o1-google-cloud-storage-api-key.json
7. Download secrets for faucet API token -- scripts/o1-discord-api-key
8. In coda automation, checkout test-public-testnet-deploy branch
9. This deployment is located in pickles/ testnet
10. Run `./scripts/auto-deploy.sh pickles keys/`

### Collect User Key Submissions

The purpose of a public testnet is to allow end-users to try out the software and learn how to operate it. Thus, we accept sign-ups for stake to be allocated in the genesis, and commit those keys to the compiled genesis ledger.

For context, these keys correspond to the "Fish Keys" in the QA Net deployments, and Online Fish Keys are ommitted in a Public Testnet deployment and "Offline Fish Keys" are instead delegated to the submitted User Keys.

### Generate Keys

As in a QA Network, keys are managed by `scripts/testnet-keys.py`, you need to generate keys for each role and/or service you intend to deploy.

In the case of a public testnet, the following commands could be run:

```
python3 scripts/testnet-keys.py keys  generate-offline-fish-keys --count <nUserSubmissions>
python3 scripts/testnet-keys.py keys  generate-offline-whale-keys --count 5
python3 scripts/testnet-keys.py keys  generate-online-whale-keys --count 5
python3 scripts/testnet-keys.py keys  generate-service-keys //(faucet, echo, etc...)
```

These commands will generate folders in the `scripts` directory by default, this output directory is a configurable location.

```
$ python3 scripts/testnet-keys.py keys generate-offline-fish-keys --help
Usage: testnet-keys.py keys generate-offline-fish-keys [OPTIONS]

  Generate Public Keys for Offline Fish Accounts

Options:
  --count INTEGER      Number of Fish Account keys to generate.
  --output-dir TEXT    Directory to output Fish Account Keys to.
  --privkey-pass TEXT  The password to use when generating keys.
  --help               Show this message and exit.
```

### Generate Genesis Ledger

Once you have the keys for your deploymenet created, and the Staker Keys saved to a CSV, you can use them to generate a genesis ledger with the following command.

```
python3 scripts/testnet-keys.py ledger generate-ledger
```

The script will try to load keys from the default directories here, so if you wrote them to a different spot (or moved them), you can pass the location via the CLI.

```
$ python3 scripts/testnet-keys.py ledger generate-ledger --help
Usage: testnet-keys.py ledger generate-ledger [OPTIONS]

  Generates a Genesis Ledger based on previously generated Whale, Fish, and
  Block Producer keys.  If keys are not present on the filesystem at the
  specified location, they are not generated.

Options:
  --generate-remainder TEXT       Indicates that keys should be generated if
                                  there are not a sufficient number of keys
                                  present.
  --service-accounts-directory TEXT
                                  Directory where Service Account Keys will be
                                  stored.
  --num-whale-accounts INTEGER    Number of Whale accounts to be generated.
  --online-whale-accounts-directory TEXT
                                  Directory where Offline Whale Account Keys
                                  will be stored.
  --offline-whale-accounts-directory TEXT
                                  Directory where Offline Whale Account Keys
                                  will be stored.
  --num-fish-accounts INTEGER     Number of Fish accounts to be generated.
  --online-fish-accounts-directory TEXT
                                  Directory where Online Fish Account Keys
                                  will be stored.
  --offline-fish-accounts-directory TEXT
                                  Directory where Offline Fish Account Keys
                                  will be stored.
  --staker-csv-file TEXT          Location of a CSV file detailing Discord
                                  Username and Public Key for Stakers.
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

There's several gotchas here that the script will check for:

- For a particular block producer "class", number of offline and online keys must be equal
- Remember the path to the ledger file here, you will need it as an input to your deployment

### Create a Testnet

Next, you must create a new testnet in `terraform/testnets/`. For ease of use, you can copy-paste an existing one, however it's important to go through the terraform and change the following things:

- location of Terraform state file
- Name of testnet
- number of nodes to deploy
- Location of the Genesis Ledger

In addition, you must include one or more public seed nodes for users to bootstrap with:

```
module "network" {
  source         = "../../modules/google-cloud/vpc-network"
  network_name   = "${local.netname}-testnet-network"
  network_region = "us-west1"

  type    = "A"
  ttl     = "300"
  records = [module.seed_two.instance_external_ip]
}
```

### Autodeploy.sh

Assuming the hard task of configuration has been completed without error, this script will make your deployment experience a _breeze_.

This script will do the following:

- Attempt to tear down (aka "destroy") the existing testnet, should it exist
- Deploy anew the testnet as defined in the previous section
- Upload the online keys you generated to Kubernetes as Secrets for use at runtime

Note: The deployment of keys relies on kubectl being properly configured for the cluster you are deploying to!

```
./scripts/auto-deploy.sh <testnet>
```

# Testnet SDK

We've included a utility tool to help with the process of spinning up a network. To use the tool clone the repo and run the following commands:

```
yarn
yarn build
yarn link
```

Now you can use the `coda-network` command. To use some of the functionality, you'll need a [Google Cloud Service Account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts). Once you download the key for the service account, use the following command to configure it:

```
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<PATH_TO_KEYFILE>
```

Try the following command to get started:

```
coda-network --help
```

Some of the common commands are:

```
coda-network keypair create
coda-netowrk keyset create -n <KEYSET_NAME>
coda-network keyset add -n <KEYSET_NAME> -k <PUBLIC_KEY>
coda-network genesis create
```
